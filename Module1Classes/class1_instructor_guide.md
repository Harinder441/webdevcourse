# Class 1: Introduction to Web Development
## Duration: 1-2 hours

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, students should be able to:
- Explain how the internet works at a high level
- Understand client-server architecture
- Describe the role of HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Create basic wireframes for web applications
- Understand the importance of planning in web development

### Required Materials
- Whiteboard/Digital board
- Web browser
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Drawing tools for wireframing (can be paper/pencil or digital tools like Figma)

### Class Structure

#### 1. Introduction (15 minutes)
- Course overview
- Introduction to web development career paths
- Brief history of the web

#### 2. How the Internet Works (20 minutes)

##### Key Concepts to Cover:
- Internet as a network of computers
- IP addresses and domain names
- DNS (Domain Name System)

##### Teaching Example: 
Explain using the analogy of sending a letter:
IP Address = Street address
Domain Name = Person's name
DNS = Phone book that converts names to addresses

#### 3. Client-Server Architecture (20 minutes)

##### Key Concepts:
- What is a client?
- What is a server?
- Request-response cycle

##### Interactive Demonstration:

#### 4. HTTP/HTTPS Protocols (15 minutes)

##### Key Points:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- HTTPS and security

##### Activity:
Have students use browser developer tools to:
- Observe HTTP methods in action
- Identify common status codes
- Notice HTTPS padlock in browser

#### 5. Wireframing (30 minutes)

##### Introduction to Wireframing:
- Purpose of wireframes
- Different fidelity levels
- Tools available

##### Practical Exercise:
Guide students through creating the TODO list wireframe:

1. Show the example wireframe:

```html:Module1Components/class1_wireframe.html
<!-- Reference the existing wireframe file -->
```

2. Have students create their own wireframe for the TODO list including:
- Header section
- Task input area
- Task list display
- Basic navigation elements

### Common Student Questions

1. Q: "Why do we start with wireframes instead of coding?"
   A: Wireframes help plan user experience and interface before investing time in code. They're easier to modify and get stakeholder approval.

2. Q: "What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?"
   A: HTTPS adds encryption for security. Data sent between client and server is protected from tampering and eavesdropping.

### Assessment Activities

1. Quick Quiz:
- What is the primary function of DNS?
- Name three HTTP methods and their purposes
- What does HTTPS add to HTTP?

2. Practical Exercise:
- Create a wireframe for a simple blog homepage
- Identify client-server components in a common website

### Additional Resources

1. Reading Materials:
- MDN Web Docs: "How the Internet Works"
- Nielsen Norman Group: "Wireframing Guidelines"

2. Tools:
- Figma (wireframing)
- draw.io (architecture diagrams)
- Browser developer tools

### Homework Assignment
1. Create detailed wireframes for two additional views of the TODO list application:
   - Task details view
   - Categories/filters view
2. Write a brief explanation of how HTTP requests work in a TODO list application
