# Class 1: Introduction to Web Development
## Understanding Web Fundamentals and Planning

### 1. How the Internet Works

#### Basic Concepts
- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers
- Each computer on the internet has a unique address (IP address)
- Domain names provide human-readable addresses for websites
- DNS (Domain Name System) converts domain names to IP addresses

#### Real-world Analogy
Think of the internet like a postal system:
- IP Address = Street address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Domain Name = Person's name (e.g., google.com)
- DNS = Phone book that looks up addresses
- Data packets = Letters being sent

### 2. Client-Server Architecture

#### What is a Client?
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile apps
- Any device requesting information

#### What is a Server?
- Computer that stores and provides resources
- Processes requests from clients
- Sends back responses
- Can be web servers, database servers, etc.

#### Request-Response Cycle
1. Client makes a request (e.g., clicking a link)
2. Request travels through the internet
3. Server receives and processes request
4. Server sends back response
5. Client receives and displays response

### 3. HTTP/HTTPS Protocols

#### HTTP Methods
- GET: Request data (like viewing a webpage)
- POST: Submit data (like submitting a form)
- PUT: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data

#### Common Status Codes
- 200: Success
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server Error
- 403: Forbidden

#### HTTPS Security
- Encrypted version of HTTP
- Protects sensitive data
- Shows padlock icon in browser
- Required for modern websites

### 4. Web Development Planning

#### Why Plan First?
- Saves development time
- Ensures clear project direction
- Helps identify potential issues early
- Makes collaboration easier
- Provides clear goals and milestones

#### Wireframing Basics
- Low-fidelity visual guide
- Shows layout and structure
- No colors or detailed design
- Focus on functionality and user flow

#### Example: TODO List Application Planning

1. Key Features to Plan:
   - Task creation
   - Task listing
   - Task management (edit/delete)
   - Categories/priorities
   - User interface layout

2. Basic Wireframe Elements:
   - Header with application name
   - Task input section
   - Task list display area
   - Action buttons
   - Navigation elements

### 5. Practical Exercise Description

Create a basic wireframe for a TODO list application:

1. Header Section:
   - Application title
   - Navigation menu
   - User account area

2. Task Input Area:
   - Task title field
   - Description field
   - Priority selector
   - Add button

3. Task List Section:
   - Individual task items
   - Completion checkboxes
   - Edit/delete options
   - Priority indicators

### 6. Development Tools Introduction

#### Essential Tools
- Text Editor (VS Code, Sublime Text)
- Web Browser (Chrome recommended for dev tools)
- Git for version control
- Drawing tools for wireframes (paper/digital)

#### Browser Developer Tools
- View page source
- Inspect elements
- Network requests
- Console messages
- Performance metrics

### Homework Assignment

1. Planning Exercise:
   - Create wireframes for:
     * Task details view
     * Category management view
   - List potential features for the TODO application
   - Describe the user flow for adding and managing tasks

2. Research Task:
   - Explore different TODO applications online
   - Note their features and interfaces
   - Write brief comparison of their approaches

### Additional Resources

1. Documentation:
   - MDN Web Docs: Introduction to Web Development
   - W3Schools Web Development Tutorial
   - HTTP Status Codes Reference

2. Tools:
   - draw.io for diagrams
   - Figma/Sketch for wireframes
   - Chrome DevTools documentation
